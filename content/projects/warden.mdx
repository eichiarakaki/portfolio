# Warden - Security and Access Control

## Overview

**Warden** is the planned security, authentication, and access control component within The Genie Project infrastructure. It will provide comprehensive security services to protect the trading system from unauthorized access and malicious activities.

## Role in TheGenieProject Infrastructure

Warden will serve as the security enforcement layer, responsible for:

1. **Authentication**: User and service identity verification
2. **Authorization**: Access control and permission management
3. **API Security**: Protection of external interfaces and data endpoints
4. **Audit Logging**: Security event tracking and compliance reporting
5. **Threat Detection**: Monitoring for suspicious activities and potential breaches

## Planned Features

- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Secure access to system interfaces
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions for different user types
- **API Key Management**: Secure credential distribution and rotation
- **Encryption Services**: Data protection for sensitive information
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and response
- **Compliance Reporting**: Audit trails for regulatory requirements

## Architecture Components (Planned)

- **Authentication Service**: Identity verification and token management
- **Authorization Engine**: Policy enforcement and access decisions
- **Security Gateway**: API protection and request filtering
- **Audit Logger**: Security event recording and analysis
- **Key Management**: Cryptographic key lifecycle management

## Current Status

Warden is currently a placeholder component with planned security architecture. Implementation will follow the stabilization of core trading components and establishment of security requirements.

## Integration Points

Warden will secure access to:
- Mercury (Data Provider) - GraphQL API and data endpoints
- Vault (Portfolio Manager) - Administrative interfaces
- Apollo (Strategy Engine) - Configuration and management APIs
- External Integrations - Third-party data sources and execution venues
