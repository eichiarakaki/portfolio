# Sentinel - Monitoring and Alerting System

## Overview

**Sentinel** is the planned monitoring, alerting, and system health management component within The Genie Project infrastructure. It will provide comprehensive observability and automated response capabilities for the trading ecosystem.

## Role in The Genie Project Infrastructure

Sentinel will serve as the operational oversight layer, responsible for:

1. **System Monitoring**: Continuous health checking of all microservices
2. **Performance Metrics**: Collection and analysis of system and trading performance data
3. **Alert Management**: Automated notifications for system anomalies and trading events
4. **Incident Response**: Coordinated response to system failures and market events
5. **Logging Aggregation**: Centralized logging and log analysis across components

## Planned Features

- **Real-time Dashboards**: Visual monitoring of system health and trading activity
- **Automated Alerts**: Configurable thresholds for performance and error conditions
- **Log Analysis**: Pattern recognition and anomaly detection in system logs
- **Health Checks**: Proactive monitoring of service availability and responsiveness
- **Performance Profiling**: Detailed analysis of latency, throughput, and resource usage

## Architecture Components (Planned)

- **Monitoring Agent**: Distributed agents on each microservice
- **Metrics Collector**: Time-series data aggregation and storage
- **Alert Engine**: Rule-based notification system
- **Dashboard Interface**: Web-based monitoring console
- **Log Processor**: Centralized log ingestion and analysis

## Current Status

Sentinel is currently a placeholder component with planned architecture. Development will begin once core trading functionality (Apollo, Mercury, Vault) is stabilized.

## Integration Points

Sentinel will monitor and alert on:
- Apollo (Strategy Engine) - signal generation performance and errors
- Mercury (Data Provider) - data feed health and latency
- Vault (Portfolio Manager) - portfolio metrics and risk thresholds
- System Infrastructure - resource usage and network connectivity
