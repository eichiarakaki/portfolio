# The Genie Project

TheGenieProject is a comprehensive, high-performance cryptocurrency trading ecosystem built in Rust. It provides a modular, microservices-based architecture designed for both backtesting and live trading of algorithmic strategies. The system integrates data ingestion, strategy execution, portfolio management, and risk control to enable sophisticated quantitative trading operations.

## Core Components

### Apollo
The strategy engine responsible for executing trading algorithms. It processes market data from Mercury, applies quantitative indicators and strategies, and generates trading signals that are communicated to the portfolio manager.

### Mercury
A high-performance data provider that handles both historical and real-time cryptocurrency market data. It supports:
- Historical data distribution from Parquet files via ZeroMQ topics
- Live data ingestion from cryptocurrency exchanges (e.g., Binance API)
- GraphQL API for external querying
- Unified data schema to ensure compatibility between backtesting and live trading modes

### Mercury Client
A client library that normalizes data streams from Mercury, providing a unified interface for both backtest and live trading modes. It handles automatic reconnection, heartbeat management, and topic-based data distribution.

### Vault
The portfolio manager that oversees capital allocation, risk management, and position sizing. It receives trading signals from Apollo, applies portfolio-level rules, and generates trade intentions based on the Kelly Criterion and diversification constraints.

### GINP (Genie's Internal Network Protocol)
A library defining standardized data structures and protocols for internal communication between components, ensuring consistent signal envelopes and snapshots across the system.

### Sentinel and Warden
Additional components currently in development or placeholder status for enhanced monitoring and security features.

## Key Features

- **High-Performance Architecture**: Built with Rust and Tokio for low-latency, concurrent processing
- **Unified Data Schema**: Eliminates compatibility issues between historical and real-time data
- **Modular Strategy Framework**: Standardized trait-based strategy interface for easy development and deployment
- **Risk-Aware Portfolio Management**: Dynamic position sizing with Kelly Criterion and rebalancing
- **Fault-Tolerant Design**: Heartbeat systems, automatic reconnection, and graceful shutdown handling
- **Configurable System**: TOML-based configuration for flexible deployment across environments

## Supported Trading Modes

- **Backtesting**: Historical data replay with synchronized OHLCV and trade data
- **Live Trading**: Real-time data processing with low-latency signal generation and execution

The system is designed to scale from single-strategy backtesting to multi-asset, multi-strategy live trading operations while maintaining data integrity and system reliability.
