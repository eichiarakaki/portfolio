<strong>Local Cloud is a LAN-first microservice system for submitting video URLs, downloading and transcoding them server-side, storing metadata in MySQL, and presenting the catalog via a React web app. Services communicate over TCP sockets with a lightweight custom message queue orchestrating downloads. The stack centers on Go for backend services and React + Vite + Tailwind for the frontend.</strong>
