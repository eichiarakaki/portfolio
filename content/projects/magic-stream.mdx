## About
This project is a full-stack simulation of a modern Movie Streaming Platform, designed to showcase how different technologies can be combined to deliver a scalable, AI-powered application.

The system brings together a React-based frontend for an engaging user experience, a Go-based backend for high-performance API services that runs on the gin (gin-gonic) web framework, and an AI-powered recommendation engine to personalize movie suggestions using Gemini.

It also demonstrates how MongoDB can serve as a reliable, scalable database solution for managing media metadata and user preferences.

## Features
